\block{Abstract}{
$\RbTeX$ is a package that provides support for running Ruby code during compilation of \LaTeX\
documents. \LaTeX\ is generally regarded as a static language (although packages that provide
dynamic features do exist), but Ruby adds a very powerful set of features and libraries that can
be used inside of \LaTeX, analogous to the relationship between JavaScript and HTML.
}

\block{Motivation}{
Modern \LaTeX\ distributions include a tool called \luatex\ that allows users to
dynamically produce content via use of Lua code. Unfortunately, the Lua standard libraries do not
have as much functionality as other popular scripting languages, such as Ruby. The goal of this
project is to incorporate Ruby into \LaTeX\ in a manner similar to \luatex, but with the power and
simplicity of Ruby over Lua.\\

Ruby was chosen over various other languages due to its widespread availability, its powerful yet
simple package manager, \inlinecode{gem}, and its easy to understand syntax. Statements in other
scripting languages, such as Python, require specific indentations or are very verbose. Ruby
manages to cut away a lot of the code that needs to be written in other languages. Ruby is also
built to support the modern web; as a result many of the gems provide one-line access to online
APIs and endpoints that may be of interest to mathematicians, scientists, and anyone else who uses
\LaTeX.
}

\block{The $\RbTeX$ Package}{
Since the program unites Ruby and \LaTeX, it is hard to find a common place to host the package.
RubyGems's policies are more lax than CTAN's, so the package is hosted as a gem. However, the gem is
not enough by itself (although it is possible to have just the gem and to require it in a user's
standalone Ruby project). Since the \inlinecode{rbtex} gem only comes with the ruby side, users need
to get the install script from the official repository and run that instead. The install script
provides users with both the Ruby gem \textit{and} the \LaTeX\ package. Users who want this package
need to have an up-to-date Ruby version and \TeX Live.

\block{How It Works}{
In order to correctly compile a document using $\RbTeX$, one must run the \rbtexc\ command on a valid
\LaTeX\ document. The workflow of $\RbTeX$ looks like\\

\resizebox{0.45\textwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}

    \node[state] (start) {Run $\RbTeX$};
    \node[state] (scan) [right =10cm of start] {Scan \TeX\ Doc};
    \node[state] (extract) [below right =10cm of scan] {Extract Ruby Code};
    \node[state] (run) [right =10cm of extract] {Run Ruby Code};
    \node[state] (cap) [right =10cm of run] {Capture Output};
    \node[state] (new) [right =10cm of cap] {Create \inlinecode{.rtx} Doc};
    \node[state] (newc) [right =10cm of new]{Compile \inlinecode{.rtx} Doc};
    \node[state] (oldc) [above =10cm of newc]{Compile \inlinecode{.tex} Doc};
    \node[state] (pdf) [below right =10cm of oldc]{PDF created};

    \path[->]
    (start)     edge node [above] {\rbtexc\ Starts} (scan)
    (scan)      edge node [bend right=45, sloped, above] {Create \inlinecode{.rb} file} (extract)
                edge node [bend right=45, sloped, above] {No \rbtexc\ environments found} (oldc)
    (extract)   edge node [above] {Start Ruby interpreter} (run)
    (run)       edge node [above] {Output to \inlinecode{.aux.rtx}} (cap)
    (cap)       edge node [above] {Create new \LaTeX\ file} (new)
    (new)       edge node [above] {Give control to \LaTeX} (newc)
    (newc)      edge node [bend right, sloped, below] {\LaTeX\ magic} (pdf)
    (oldc)      edge node [bend right, sloped, above] {\LaTeX\ magic} (pdf);

\end{tikzpicture}
}
\noindent\\
Unlike many \LaTeX\ packages, $\RbTeX$ runs outside of \TeX. This allows a user to have the ability
to do what they are used to, rather than having to obey the rules of \LaTeX. In fact, the \rbtexc\
program is removed from Ruby as well. The \rbtexc\ program parses both Ruby code and \LaTeX\ code
into it's own code, which it is then able to parse back into \LaTeX\ code. In case a user forgets
to use \inlinecode{pdflatex} and uses \rbtexc\ on a \TeX\ document not containing any
\inlinecode{rbtex} environements, \rbtexc\ just runs \inlinecode{pdflatex} and skips all the extra
steps.

\block{Basic Usage}{
In order to use $\RbTeX$, a user needs to do three things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Include the \inlinecode{rubylatex} package in their \TeX\ document.
\item Wrap all Ruby code in \inlinecode{rbtex} environments.
\item Run \rbtexc\ in the Terminal/Command Line to compile the document and produce a pdf.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent\\
A minimal working example look something like this:\\
\inputminted[fontsize=\small,linenos,xleftmargin=0.5cm]{tex}{mwe.tex}
\noindent\\
