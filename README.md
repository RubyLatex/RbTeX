# About this project
I love LaTeX. Seriously, it is the most amazing piece of software to ever be created. But, despite
its Turing completeness, it's just not built for dynamic programming. Sure, there's LuaLaTeX,
but no one really uses Lua, and the Lua standard libraries are very lacking in power. This
project is dedicated to bringing the power of Ruby to LaTeX.  

# Building
Please don't until everything is as it should be. Right now this project is incredibly messy, and
I can't promise that the project will build from commit to commit. Eventually I'll change this,
and a stable release will be out there, and the power of RbTeX will be at your fingertips.
