# About this project
I love LaTeX. Seriously, it is the most amazing piece of software to ever be created. But, despite
its Turing completeness, it's just not built for dynamic programming. Sure, there's LuaLaTeX,
but no one really uses Lua, and the Lua standard libraries are very lacking in power. This
project is dedicated to bringing the power of Ruby to LaTeX.
